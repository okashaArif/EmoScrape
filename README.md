EMOSCRAPE

📌 Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that scrapes data from Reddit and Twitter based on user-defined keywords. It then applies sentiment analysis to the extracted data and displays the results in a user-friendly dashboard.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Flask

Web Scraping: Reddit & Twitter APIs

Sentiment Analysis: NLP libraries (TextBlob, VADER, or similar)

🔥 Features

✅ Keyword-Based Scraping: Fetch real-time data from Reddit and Twitter.

✅ Sentiment Analysis: Classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral.

✅ Interactive Dashboard: Display results dynamically using React.

✅ Flask API: Handle data processing and sentiment analysis.


📊 Sentiment Analysis Results

The extracted posts are analyzed for sentiment.

A graphical representation of sentiment distribution is displayed.

Users can filter results based on time, sentiment, or platform.

📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 Implement real-time updates for scraping.

🔹 Improve accuracy with deep learning-based sentiment analysis.

🔹 Add more visualization and filtering options.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
